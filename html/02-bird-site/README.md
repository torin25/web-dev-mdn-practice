# Bird watching site (HTML Task)

This project is a simple, responsive birdwatching website built as a learning exercise based on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

## What I learned

- Usage of semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<address>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`and `<footer>`
- Structuring real-world content
- Creating a navigation bar with links
- Organizing content with Flexbox and CSS Grid

## Files

- `bird.html` – The HTML structure of the letter
- `bird.css` – Styling for the layout and typography
- `images-folder` - Contains the images of the birds used in the website
