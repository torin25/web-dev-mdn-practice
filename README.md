# MDN Web Development Tasks

This repository contains my solutions to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practice tasks based on the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) learning path.

## Structure

- `html/` – HTML practice projects and tasks
- `css/` – CSS tasks and exercises
- `javascript/` – JavaScript learning and challenges

Each section contains subfolders with the respective practice task, their code, and a README explaining the task.

## Why This Repo?

I'm using this to:

- Track my web development progress
- Practice clean code structure and documentation
- Build a public learning record
